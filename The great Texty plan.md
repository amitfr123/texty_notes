This note is the central note for the Texty text editor. 
This text editor is meant to be for a game engine development environment.
But because the roundabout path is always more fun a reinvention of the wheel is needed. 

Here is the to-do list/different big subjects for this project:
1) Extendable using a custom scripting language named [[Chipi]].
2) Raw OpenGL based GUI.
3) Be quick.
4) Full debugging capabilities.
